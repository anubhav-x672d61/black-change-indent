`change-indent` branch is collect changes to have 3-space indent.

See the original "README.md" file in `main` branch for the details about the original software.

I have no desire to push the changes to "psf/Black". Instead of a
"fork-on-GitHub", I would have preferred some way to be able to "clone; make
changes in a separate branch; perhaps catch up with original repository once a
while". That requires more work (clone original locally; send a copy to GitHub;
catch up locally with original repository; send changes to GitHub.).
